Welcome to RForecast.py's documentation!
========================================
RForecast.py is a Python wrapper that exposes most of the functionality of 
R's Forecast package in python. Some related functions in the stats and base 
packages are also exposed (e.g. seasonal decompositions). A 
few less-commnonly used functions and arguments are not exposed. 

.. math::
  (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
  
Since Pythagoras, we know that :math:`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`.
