Welcome to rforecast.py |version|
=====================================

The forecast package in R offers best-of-breed automatic forecasting methods 
for univariate time series. 
Its automatic model selection makes it relatively easy to use. 
There is no equivalent available in Python.
This project uses rpy2 to expose most of the functionality of the forecast package 
in Python, allowing Python users access to its forecasting tools, while expressing 
the inputs and outputs in familiar Pandas objects.
