  '''
  Funtction for interpolating missing values in R time series. This function 
  uses linear interpolation for non-seasonal data. For seasonal data, it 
  uses an STL decomposition, imputing the seasonal value.
  
  Args:
    x: an R time series, with values that are on the scale of a BoxCox
      transformation with parameter lambda=lam
    lam: BoxCox transformation parameter. The default is R's NULL value.
      If NULL, no transformation is applied. Otherwise, a Box-Cox 
      transformation is applied before forecasting and inverted after.  
      
  Returns:
    the time series x, with any NA values filled with imputed values

def accuracy(fc, x=None, **kwargs):
  '''
  Args:
    fc: an R forecast object, or an R vector containing forecasts
    x: optional R vector of true values for the forecast (test data)
    d: Number of first differences taken in forecast, default is none.
    D: Number of seasonal differences taken in forecast, default is none.

  Returns:
    An R list of forecast accuracy measures. 
    Use extractors.accuracy to get a Pandas DataFrame.
