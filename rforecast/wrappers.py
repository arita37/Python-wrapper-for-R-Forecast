  Funtction for interpolating missing values in R time series. This function 
  uses linear interpolation for non-seasonal data. For seasonal data, it 
  uses an STL decomposition, imputing the seasonal value.
  
  Args:
    x: an R time series, obtained from converters.ts(), or a Pandas Series
      with the correct index (e.g. from converters.sequence_as_series().
      If lam is used, its values should be on the scale of a BoxCox
      transformation with parameter lambda=lam.
    lam: BoxCox transformation parameter. The default is R's NULL value.
      If NULL, no transformation is applied. Otherwise, a Box-Cox 
      transformation is applied before forecasting and inverted after.  
      
  Returns:
    If x is an R ts object, an R time series is returned. 
    If x is a Pandas Series, a Pandas Series is returned.

  '''
  Computes an R matrix of forecast accuracy measures. Must take an R forecast 
  object for input, since the residuals are not included in the Pandas 
  output from forecast functions.  One step-ahead errors are computed over the 
  training data. Optionally, test data (x) can be included, in which case the 
  error measures are evaluated over the test set.
  
  The accuracy measures used are:
    * Mean Error (ME)
    * Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
    * Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    * Mean Percentage Error (MPE)
    * Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
    * Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE)
    * Autocorrelatino of Errors at Lag 1 (ACF1)
    * Theil's U (only if x provided)
  
  Args:
    fc: an R forecast object
    x: optional R vector of true values for the forecast (test data)
    d: Number of first differences taken in forecast, default is none.
    D: Number of seasonal differences taken in forecast, default is none.

  Returns:
    An R list of forecast accuracy measures. 
    Use extractors.accuracy to get a Pandas DataFrame.

    replace_missing: Default True.
