'''
Converters.py handles conversions between pandas Series with various index 
types and R time series (class 'ts'). It also creates Pandas Series objects 
with the correct index types. Seasonal time series are represented 
as a Pandas Series with a MultiIndex in which the first level is the longer, 
outer time period and the second level is the cycle.

  vectors, if needed.

  Translates between python and R keyword arguments. 
  First, tuple arguments are rewritten to R vectors. Next, substitution 
  is performed for a specific list of arguments. Currently, this is just 
  'lam' -> 'lambda'; 'lambda' is a reserved word in python, but is used 
  a lot in the R Forecast package. Finally, underscore-separated keywords 
  are turned into R-style, dot-separated ones. If you need to pass an R 
  argument that has an underscore, you must put it into the 'reserved' dict.

  Turns the provided data into an R time series. Only one of frequency and

  or recycling may occur, which is usually not sensible.
  
  Args:
    data: Python sequence representing values of a regular time series.
    start: default 1; a number or 2-tuple to use as start index of sequence.
      If 2-tuple, it is (period, step), e.g. March 2010 is (2010, 3).
    end: By default this is not specified, which is usually right. 
      A number or 2-tuple (like start) to specify the end of the sequence.
    frequency: default 1; number of points in each time period
      e.g. 12 for monthly data with an annual period
    deltat: default 1; fraction of sampling period per observation 
      e.g. 1/12 for monthly data with an annual period. Only one of deltat
