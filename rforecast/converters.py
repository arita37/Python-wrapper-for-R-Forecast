'''
Converters.py handles conversions between pandas Series with various index 
types and R time series (class 'ts'). It also creates Pandas Series objects 
with the correct index types. Seasonal time series are represented 
as a Pandas Series with a MultiIndex in which the first level is the longer, 
outer time period and the second level is the cycle.

 Converts a Pandas Series with a MultiIndex into a seasonal R time series.
 The MultiIndex should only ever be used to represent seasonal series.

  Converts a normally-indexed Pandas Series to an R time series object with

  Takes a Pandas Series with either a seasonal or non-seasonal time series

  seasonal, x must have a MultiIndex encoding its levels. If it is 
  non-seasonal, x must have an ordinary index with the periods.

  '''
  Converts a list or other sequence input into a Pandas Series with the 
  correct index for the type of Series created.
  
  Args:
    x: a Python list containing time series data
    start: default 1; a number or 2-tuple to use as start index of sequence.
      If 2-tuple, it is (period, step), e.g. March 2010 is (2010, 3).
    freq: default 1; number of points in each time period
      e.g. 12 for monthly data with an annual period
